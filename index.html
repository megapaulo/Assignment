  <!-- Need to look into why code keeps breaking  -->

  <p>Pounded yam is a West African dish made from boiled yam that is pounded into a smooth, dough-like consistency.
     It's a staple food in many West African countries, particularly in Nigeria, where it's known as "iyan". </p>

  <p>Egusi is made of fat- and protein-rich seeds of certain cucurbitaceous plants (squash, melon, gourd), 
    which after being dried and ground are used as a major ingredient in West African cuisine. In Nigeria, 
    Egusi soup is one of the most popular soups used for a variety of occasions. Egusi soup is a staple in homes and 
    bukas, or street food stalls, across Nigeria and in many parts of West Africa.</p>

  <h3>Additional Information</h3>
  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p> To make a creamier egusi, in Step 2, add an additional 1/2 cup water to the blender, 
    along with the ground egusi seeds. In Step 3, stir all of the paste into the soup at once, 
    then proceed as directed.</p>
  <p> You can find ground egusi seeds in many West African stores and online</p>
  <p> You will find pumpkin leaves, also known as ugwu or ugu, 
  in Nigerian and West African stores. Curly kale and collard greens are acceptable substitutes. </p>
